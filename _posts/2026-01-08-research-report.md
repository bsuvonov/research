- I plan to implement a working code initially, that does the job, then later on optimize it for compiler, cpu and kernel
- For starters, it might be best to learn the implementation of `cache_ext` and `sched_ext`. This might be the goal for this week until January 14, unless I finish it by this coming Sunday.
